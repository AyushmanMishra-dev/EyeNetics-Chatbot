## Microaneurysms

Microaneurysms are small, round dilations of blood vessels, particularly capillaries.

### Characteristics

- Size: Typically 20 to 200 micrometers in diameter.
- Appearance: Round or oval-shaped lesions in retinal imaging.
- Location: Predominantly found in the retinal layers.

### Pathophysiology

Microaneurysms often develop due to chronic hypertension and weakening of vessel walls. In diabetic retinopathy, high blood sugar levels contribute to endothelial damage, leading to microaneurysm formation.

## Diagnostic Tools

Various imaging techniques are used to visualize and diagnose microaneurysms.

### Fluorescein Angiography

This technique highlights retinal blood vessels, making microaneurysms visible.

### Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

OCT provides detailed cross-sectional images, aiding in the quantification and assessment of microaneurysms.

## Treatment Options

Management of microaneurysms involves addressing the underlying cause.

### Laser Photocoagulation

Used to seal leaking microaneurysms, reducing the risk of complications.

### Anti-VEGF Therapy

Administered to mitigate vascular endothelial growth factor-related effects in certain cases.
